# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Supervised Learning
It uses labeled data and is divided in:
1. **Classification:** output is a value in a set C (categories).
	1. ***k*-nearest neighbors:** tries to predict the label of a point by looking at the $k$ closest labeled points;
	[scikit learn example](https://github.com/letyrobueno/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Supervised-Learning/Classification/scikitlearn_iris.py).

2. **Regression:** output is a value in R (continuous).

In Python we can use scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras.

## Unsupervised Learning
It tries to discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Main tasks:
1. **Clustering**: tries to discover the underlying groups (clusters) in a dataset;
	1. ***k*-means clustering:** finds clusters given a number of clusters (scikit-learn);
2. **Data visualization:** hierarchical clustering and t-SNE;
3. **Dimension reduction techniques:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA);
4. **Dimension reduction techniques:** Non-negative matrix factorization" ("NMF").

## Reinforcement Learning
Interaction with environment to learn how to optimize behavior, using a system of rewards and punishments.
